    <h1>Does economic growth <br> affect mobile penetration?</h1>
    <p> Our agenda...I've been passionately following mobile technology for decades. In the beginning, the mobile devices weren't very mobile <br> and a strong back and arms were required to lug them around.<br> They always had to be next to a power outlet, as there was no such thing as batteries.</p>
    <p>The technology that drives mobile devices has improved a lot since those days, and especially in the last ten years.<br> Mobile gadgets have gotten smaller, more powerful, and very useful. They are everywhere and play increasingly greater roles in the lives of<br> most everyone. Availability of mobile devices is rapidly spreading throughout the world and making significant improvements in many lives.</p>
